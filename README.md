# sudoku
This is a Sudoku solving program (or Sudoku AI to be fancy) that I wrote from scratch to practice data manipulation using numpy as well as testing different Sudoku algorithms.

Try out the algorithms with the code below:

```py
# Backtrack Algorithm
python entrypoint.py BacktrackSolver
# A solver that mimic human tactic
python entrypoint.py Human
```
